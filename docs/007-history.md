## Executing Commands from your Bash History
~~~
Printing off our history is nice, but, by itself, it doesn't really help us access those commands easily, except as a reference. However, we can quickly recall any of the returned output using a special syntax.

We can recall any of our previous history by its number preceded by an exclamation point (!). For instance, if your history looks like mine above, you could see the man page for the history command quickly by typing:

!5
